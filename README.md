# The Story

At the conceptualization of this project, I knew it would be a rather difficult project. I did find an API that had all the data I needed in a very organized structure, but I couldn't get access to the API because the the company ABIOS' person that handles their permissions was out of the office. The good news is the week after the project they can discuss permissions. Awesome.

So I have had to settle for a very incomple API to supply the data for the app. Once again, a huge problem arose. The data that is stored in this API is terribly organized and I have had to employ some very creative ways of displaying the data. I am in a place now where a backend could be implemented, but I ran out of time before being able to implement it. After discussing this with Ryan, he said to focus on the presentation and so I have. This is a perfect foundation for an app of this nature and with another week of work, it can be something truly unique and remarkable.
